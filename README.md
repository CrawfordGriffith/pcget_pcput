PCGET and PCPUT Customizations
------------------------------

This repository contains versions of `PCGET` and `PCPUT` customized for various computers running CP/M. `PCGET` and `PCPUT` were started by [Mike Douglas](http://deramp.com/) as a simple way to get files to and from vintage computers, when using another computer with a terminal emulator as the console port. His work is based on [Ward Christensen's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Christensen) [XMODEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMODEM) implementation as found in CP/M `MODEM` programs.
